                <div class="post-body">
                    <p>I have spent 14 years scaling B2B security companies. I have sat across the table from hundreds of CISOs negotiating seven-figure contracts. And I can tell you with certainty: the way enterprise security teams buy SIEM technology is undergoing a fundamental shift.</p>

                    <p>The pattern is unmistakable. Every CISO conversation I have had in the last 18 months circles back to the same frustrations: per-GB pricing that punishes data growth, proprietary formats that create exit barriers, and multi-year contracts that lock teams into platforms they have already outgrown.</p>

                    <p>The old playbook is dead. Here is what is replacing it.</p>

                    <h2>The Legacy SIEM Era Is Over</h2>

                    <p>The SIEM market went through its first major wave in the 2010s. Correlation engines and rule-based detection were state of the art. Security teams wrote static rules, tuned thresholds, and tried to keep up with alert volumes that grew faster than headcount.</p>

                    <p>The problems were structural, not operational. Alert fatigue buried real threats in noise. False positives consumed analyst time. And the detection logic could not adapt to novel attack patterns because it was fundamentally reactive. You wrote a rule after you saw a technique. By definition, you were always behind.</p>

                    <p>These platforms served their purpose. But the threat landscape moved on, and legacy SIEMs did not.</p>

                    <h2>What AI-Native SIEMs Actually Change</h2>

                    <p>The second wave, the one we are in now, is built on machine learning for detection, investigation, and response. This is not about bolting an ML model onto a legacy architecture. It is about rethinking the entire pipeline.</p>

                    <p>AI-native SIEMs turn the SOC from a cost center into a force multiplier. Instead of analysts manually triaging thousands of alerts, machine learning models handle the initial investigation, correlate signals across data sources, and surface only the incidents that require human judgment.</p>

                    <p>The difference is not incremental. It is categorical. Mean time to respond drops from hours to seconds. False positive rates collapse. And your team focuses on threat hunting and strategic work instead of drowning in BAU noise.</p>

                    <h2>Red Flags CISOs Are Learning to Spot</h2>

                    <p>Through dozens of conversations with security leaders evaluating their next platform, I have compiled the red flags that experienced buyers now watch for:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pricing that penalizes data growth:</strong> If your cost goes up linearly with data volume, your vendor is taxing your visibility. More data should mean better security, not a bigger invoice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mandatory vendor storage:</strong> If you must move all your telemetry to their infrastructure, you have handed over leverage and created a migration barrier that compounds over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Long deployment timelines:</strong> If a vendor needs 6 to 12 months to get you to production, the architecture is fighting you. Modern platforms deploy in weeks, not quarters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heavy professional services:</strong> If the platform requires a small army of consultants to operate, the product is not finished. Professional services should be optional, not required.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited autonomous capabilities:</strong> If the "AI" is just a chatbot wrapper over a search bar, you are paying for marketing, not technology.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proprietary data formats:</strong> If your data goes in but cannot come out cleanly, you are building on quicksand.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What Smart Buyers Are Evaluating Instead</h2>

                    <p>The CISOs who are ahead of this curve have shifted their evaluation criteria. Here is what they are prioritizing:</p>

                    <h3>AI and ML Detection Quality</h3>

                    <p>Not "does it have AI" but "how does the AI actually work." They want to understand the detection models, the training data, the false positive rates, and the ability to tune and customize. Black-box detection is a non-starter for mature security teams.</p>

                    <h3>Automation Depth</h3>

                    <p>Surface-level automation that sends a Slack notification is table stakes. Smart buyers want autonomous triage, investigation, and response. They want to see what percentage of alerts the platform can fully resolve without human intervention.</p>

                    <h3>Data Architecture and BYODb Support</h3>

                    <p>This is the big one. Bring Your Own Database means your security data stays in your infrastructure. Your Snowflake, your BigQuery, your OpenSearch, your S3 buckets. The detection engine queries your data in place instead of requiring you to ship everything to yet another vendor's cloud.</p>

                    <p>BYODb eliminates the single biggest source of vendor lock-in in the SIEM market.</p>

                    <h3>Integration Ecosystem</h3>

                    <p>Security teams run 40 to 80 tools. The SIEM needs to be the connective tissue. Buyers are looking at API coverage, native integrations, and the ability to ingest and correlate data from their entire stack without custom engineering.</p>

                    <h2>The TCO Conversation Has Changed</h2>

                    <p>Total cost of ownership used to be a simple licensing calculation. Now CISOs are looking at the full picture:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Licensing costs:</strong> The sticker price is just the beginning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure costs:</strong> What compute and storage does the platform require in your environment?</li>
                        <li><strong>Data ingestion charges:</strong> Per-GB pricing creates a perverse incentive to limit visibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personnel costs:</strong> How many FTEs does it take to operate and tune the platform?</li>
                        <li><strong>Training and maintenance:</strong> What is the ongoing cost of keeping the team proficient?</li>
                        <li><strong>Hidden costs:</strong> Professional services, premium support tiers, add-on modules that should be core features.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The best buyers I talk to build a three-year TCO model before they sign anything. They account for data growth, team scaling, and the cost of a future migration if the relationship goes sideways.</p>

                    <h2>The Pattern I Keep Seeing</h2>

                    <p>Here is what is actually happening in the market. CISOs are not just switching vendors. They are rejecting the entire purchasing model that defined the last decade of enterprise security.</p>

                    <p>They want modular platforms that let them start small and expand. They want data sovereignty so they are never locked in. They want pricing that aligns with value delivered, not data volume consumed. And they want the freedom to walk away if the platform stops earning its place in the stack.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "The next generation of security platforms will be defined by what they do not lock in, not by what they lock down."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This is not a prediction. It is a pattern I am watching play out in real time across every CISO conversation I have. The vendors who adapt to this shift will win the next decade. The ones who keep optimizing for lock-in will learn an expensive lesson about what happens when enterprise buyers finally have better options.</p>

                    <p>The CISO buying shift is here. The only question is which side of it you are on.</p>

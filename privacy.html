                <h2>2. Deployment Options and Data Handling</h2>
                <p>Vigilense AI offers flexible deployment options, each with different data handling practices:</p>

                <h3>2.1 SaaS (Cloud-Hosted) Deployment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tenant Separation:</strong> All SaaS deployments are strictly tenant-separated. Your data, configurations, and environment are logically isolated from other customers using dedicated resources and encryption keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Platform Data:</strong> We store account information, configurations, detection rules, and platform usage data on our secure infrastructure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Data Options:</strong> Even in SaaS mode, you have flexibility:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Connect your own databases (BYODb) — security data stays in your infrastructure</li>
                            <li>Use our managed storage — data is encrypted and tenant-separated</li>
                            <li>Hybrid approach — combine both options based on your needs</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>AI/LLM Processing:</strong> You may choose to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use our hosted AI models for query generation and analysis</li>
                            <li>Connect your own AI/LLM models (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, self-hosted models, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Location:</strong> SaaS data is stored in US, EU, or APAC regions based on your selection. Contact us for specific data center locations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Self-Hosted (On-Premise/Private Cloud) Deployment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complete Data Control:</strong> All data, including security logs, configurations, and AI processing, remains entirely within your infrastructure.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> We do not receive, store, or process any of your security data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your AI Models:</strong> Use your own AI/LLM models with complete control over data processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>License Validation:</strong> Minimal license validation data may be transmitted (license key, version, feature usage counts). This can be disabled for air-gapped deployments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Telemetry (Optional):</strong> You may opt-in to share anonymized usage telemetry to help improve the product. This is disabled by default and can be completely turned off.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.3 BYODb (Bring Your Own Database) Architecture</h3>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> With our BYODb architecture, available in both SaaS and self-hosted deployments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your security logs and event data remain in YOUR infrastructure.</li>
                    <li>Vigilense AI queries your databases in real-time and processes data in memory.</li>
                    <li>We do not store, copy, cache, or retain your security data on our servers.</li>
                    <li>Query results are transmitted over encrypted connections and discarded after display.</li>
                    <li>You maintain full control over data retention, storage locations, encryption, and access.</li>
                    <li>Database credentials are encrypted at rest using HSM-backed keys and are never logged.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Tenant Separation and Isolation</h2>
                <p>For SaaS deployments, we implement strict tenant separation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Logical Isolation:</strong> Each customer's data is logically separated using unique tenant identifiers and access controls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption Separation:</strong> Each tenant has dedicated encryption keys managed via AWS KMS / Azure Key Vault.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Isolation:</strong> Network-level controls, security groups, and VPC configurations prevent cross-tenant data access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compute Isolation:</strong> Tenant workloads are isolated at the container/pod level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users can only access their organization's data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> All access is logged with tenant context and available for your review.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Cross-Tenant Data Sharing:</strong> We never share, aggregate, or combine data across tenants for any purpose.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <ul>

                <h3>5.3 No AI Training on Customer Data</h3>
                <p><strong>We explicitly commit:</strong> Regardless of deployment option, we NEVER use your security data, queries, configurations, or any customer content to train, improve, or develop AI/ML models. This includes:</p>
